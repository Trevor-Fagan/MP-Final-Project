# MP-Final-Project
The idea is just to have a travel journal app. We can implement a navigation
menu where there are three different tabs:
1) Places user wants to go
2) Places user has been to
3) A ranking page with all of the different places users have been in preferred order

App can use a certain layout type, use a nav menu, follow MVC architecture.
